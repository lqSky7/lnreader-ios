// SyncApplyChecks.swift - Drives the "server copy wins" mapping for real.
//
// `SyncApplier.apply` is the only place a restore touches the store, and it is
// the step that can silently do nothing: a payload that decodes but does not
// match an existing entry either creates a duplicate (which the unique
// constraint rejects) or lands nowhere visible. This builds an in-memory
// container and feeds it payloads shaped exactly like `GET /api/sync`.
