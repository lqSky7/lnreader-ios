// ChapterVisibility.swift - The one place that decides which chapters exist.
//
// A hidden scanlator's chapters, and the losing copies when priority merging is
// on, are not part of the user's chapter set. Rather than have every screen
// re-run `ScanlatorRules` over a relationship, the decision is written once to
// `Chapter.hidden` and everything else asks `!hidden` (in SQL where it counts).
//
// `ScanlatorRules` stays the only rule. This file only applies it to stored
// rows, and `ChapterTwins` (read state shared between scanlators) keeps a
// duplicate of a read chapter from showing up as new.
//
// When to call it: after a merge (`ChapterSourceSync.merge` does), after the
// scanlator rules change (`ScanlatorSettings` does), and after a restore that
// brings rules or chapters back (`LibraryMaintenance.reconcileVisibility`).
