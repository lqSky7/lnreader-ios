// ChapterOrder.swift - The one place that decides chapter order.
//
// Every surface that lists, navigates or queues chapters asks this file: the
// detail screen, the directory, both readers' chapter sheets, sync upload,
// scanlator merging and the download queue. Before it, nine call sites each had
// their own `.sorted { $0.sourceOrder < $1.sourceOrder }` and they disagreed
// about which end of `sourceOrder` was newest — which is how a list could show
// chapter 0, 1, 2 at the top while the menu said "Newest first".
//
// Two words, used the same way everywhere:
//
//   oldestFirst   reading order, chapter 1 -> N. What previous/next walk.
//   newestFirst   what the chapter list shows by default, N -> 1.
//
// One invariant makes that possible, and it is enforced in one place:
//
//   `sourceOrder` 0 is the OLDEST chapter.
//
// A source is free to list newest-first (MangaFire does); `normalized(_:)`
// reverses it once, when the list arrives, so the index that gets stored always
// counts from the oldest. Nothing downstream has to ask which way a source
// counted, and a refresh re-stamps `sourceOrder` for entries stored before this
// rule existed.
//
// `sourceOrder` stays the key — not the number, not the date — because a source
// that fixes a chapter's name or renumbers it keeps its place in the list, and
// because a novel with no numbers in its titles still has an order.
