#
# Records "Animation Hitches" (dropped and late frames, which is what scroll
# jank is) together with Time Profiler (what the main thread was doing during
# them). Release, not Debug: a Debug build's scroll numbers are not the app's.
#
# The app launches when recording starts; reproduce the problem straight away
# (open a chapter, scroll). Keep the phone unlocked. Run this from a normal
# terminal; inside an agent sandbox xcodebuild cannot resolve packages.
#
# The headless benchmark (`profile-hotpaths.sh`) covers data work only.
