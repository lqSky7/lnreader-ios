# Entry detail screen layout

How `NovelDetailView` (novels and manga) places its controls, and where a new one goes.

## What was wrong

Controls were added wherever there was room, so the screen had no rules:

- Tracking appeared twice: a toolbar icon and a labelled row between the summary and chapters.
- Author and status were shown in the hero, then again in a metadata grid.
- "Last fetched / Refresh" was a loose row of grey text with a borderless button.
- The chapter header carried four glass circles (search, filter, scanlators, downloads), two of
  which act on the whole entry, not on the list.
- Audio downloads was a toolbar icon on novels only, with no label.
- A new entry action (migrate, edit info, categories) had nowhere to go.

## The rule: a control lives with what it acts on

| Zone | Holds | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| **Hero** | Title, byline (author · artist), status · source, the one primary action (Start/Continue) | Exactly one prominent button |
| **Action bar** (`EntryActionBar`) | Entry actions that carry state: Library, Tracking, Downloads, Audio. Plain glass buttons in the hero, in the same `GlassEffectContainer` as the primary button | Four |
| **Toolbar** | Refresh, as its own button. Later a `…` menu after it for occasional entry actions: Migrate, Edit info, Categories, Share | Refresh plus one menu |
| **About** (`NovelInfoSection`) | Summary and genres. Nothing tappable except "Show more" | — |
| **Chapter header** | Controls for the list only: search, and one sort/filter menu (order, filter, scanlators) | Two buttons |

Consequences:

- **Tracking has one home**: the tracking tile. Its label is the AniList status ("Reading") once
  bound, so the summary the old row gave is still visible.
- **Downloads** moved from the chapter header to a tile; it queues chapters for the entry.
- **Scanlators** moved into the sort/filter menu, and only appears when the list has scanlators.
- **Refresh** is a visible toolbar button: it is a common action, so it is never in a menu, and
  never pull to refresh, because pulling down dismisses the screen. While it runs, the button is
  the spinner. When the entry was last fetched is shown under the chapter count.
- **Action buttons are glass over the hero**, not cards in the content below it. State shows in
  the symbol (filled when on), never as an outline or a different fill, so no secondary action
  competes with the primary button.
- The metadata grid is gone; its facts are the hero's byline and status line.

## Adding an action

1. Does it show state the user should see at a glance (on/off, a status)? Make it a tile in
   `EntryActionBar`, if fewer than four are showing for that kind. Otherwise:
2. Put it in a toolbar `…` menu after the refresh button in `NovelDetailView`. The menu does not
   exist yet because nothing needs it; **Migrate** is the action that adds it. Do not ship an
   empty menu, and do not move Refresh into it.
3. If it acts on chapters, it belongs to the chapter header's menu, not to either of the above.

Tiles per kind today: novel in library 4 (Library, Tracking, Download, Audio), manga in library 3,
browse result 1–2 (Library, Audio). Nothing that needs a library entry shows before it is added.
